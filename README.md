# u-boot-radxa-rock-4d
This repository provides a custom-built U-Boot firmware for the Radxa ROCK 4D (RK3576). Unlike the stock bootloader from the vendor, this version is specifically configured to initialize the onboard USB 3.0/2.0 controllers and the Naneng Combo PHY, enabling seamless and automatic booting from USB drives.
